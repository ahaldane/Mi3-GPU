Mi3-GPU (or Markov-Chain Inverse Ising Inference for GPUs)
===================================================================

Mi3-GPU (Mee-three) solves the "inverse Ising problem" using a GPU-parallelized Monte-Carlo sequence generation algorithm to infer Potts models. It is designed for analyzing coevolutionary mutation patterns in Multiple Sequence Alignements (MSAs)

See the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for detailed information and examples.  This software is primarily described by Ref [1], with additional details on the statistical properties of the algorithm in Ref [2].
