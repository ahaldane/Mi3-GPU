IvoGPU
======

Biophysical Potts-Model inference on the GPU using OpenCL.

This program solves the "Inverse Ising problem" using a parallelized Monte-Carlo sequence generation algorithm. That is, it solves for the real-valued coupling parameters `J^{ij}_{\alpha \beta}` of an infinite-range q-state Potts model with Hamiltonian `H(s) = \sum_{i < j}^L J^{ij}_{s_i s_j}`, given bivariate marginals which might be obtained from a multiple sequence alignment containing sequences `s` with length `L` and `q` residue types.

Rough Usage Guide
=================

Required packages: Python2, scipy/numpy, pyopencl, mwc64x.

The helper module "seqtools" must be compiled with `make seqtools` (requires gcc).
The `mwc64x` package must be obtained (available at http://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/dt10/research/rngs-gpu-mwc64x.html) and placed in a directory named `mwc64x` next to the `IvoGPU.py` script.

The `IvoGPU.py` script can then be run in a variety of modes, incuding inverse ising inference, Monte-Carlo sequence generation, and Potts energy evaluation. Run `IvoGPU.py -h` to see a list of modes (see "positional arguments"). To get more info on each mode, use the `-h` option:

    ./IvoGPU.py inverseIsing -h

To check that the script is correctly detecting the system's GPUs, run:

    ./IvoGPU.py --clinfo

An example PBS script showing a typical set of arguments for inverse ising inference is in the file `example_pbs.sh`, which will fit the bivariate marginals from the file `example_bimarg_pc.npy`, computed from an HIV dataset for sequences of length length 93 with 4 residue types. The log file will contain many details about how the program is running. The script attempts to deduce some arguments from other supplied arguments (eg the sequence length L can be deduced from any supplied sequence file).

The `seqmodel` argument deserves more detail: If set to the string 'logscore' it will initialize the coupling values accorging to the uncorrelated (logscore) model and generate corresponding initial sequences. It may also be set to a directory name corresponding to a directory containing the output of a previous run from which it will load the couplings and sequences. 

Helper scripts are also included: `changeGauge.py` transforms the Potts parameters between different gauges, and `pseudocount.py` adds different forms of pseudocount to the bivariate marginals.
